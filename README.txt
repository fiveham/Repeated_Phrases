This project allows a user to easily turn HTML-format copies of ebooks of the novels and novellas of A Song of Ice and Fire (George R. R. Martin) into individual chapter files featuring clickable links connecting instances of the same phrase.

Aside from the boring, annoying classics like "would that I could" or "enough as makes no matter", there are some repeated phrases that are suggestive, such as an Other's ice-sword and a Valyrian steel sword both being "sharper than any razor", and Moqorro seeing a vision of "a sea of blood", which the Dothraki Sea is described as looking like in Spring.

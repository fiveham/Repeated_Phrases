published_order.txt orders the books according to date of first publication. The chapters are linked in a single loop.

default_order.txt orders the books by sequencing the novels first, followed by the Dunk & Egg novells, followed by the other two extant novellas. Chapters are linked in a single loop.

a_ball_of_beasts.txt is a modification of default_order.txt in which the chapters of AFFC and ADWD are ordered in the "A Ball of Beasts" sequence, defined here: http://ballofbeasts.weebly.com/chapters.html
Note that the chapter numbers used on the preceding web page are 1-based while chapter numbers are zero-based in this application.

Note that the chapter numbers used on the preceding web page are 1-based while chapter numbers are zero-based in this application.

boiled_leather_reveal_variant.txt is a modification of boiled_leather.txt which moves two chapters to later points in the chapter sequence to prevent the story from spoiling a reveal. It is defined below the boiled leather chapter list here: http://boiledleather.com/post/24543217702/a-proposed-a-feast-for-crows-a-dance-with-dragons

individual_books.txt isolates each book from the others by giving each book's first chapter no previous-chapter link and each book's last chapter no next-chapter link. Each novella is isolated, except PQ, which has two pseudo-chapters in this application to split the footnote from the novella's main text.

closed_char_loops.txt isolates each POV character's chapters into one-character loops where that character's last chapter has that character's first chapater as its next-chapter link.

char_blocks.txt groups each character's chapters together in publication order and orders those groups by publication order; so, the first chapter's POV character's chapters all come first, then all of the second POV character's, all of the third's, and so forth.
